Q3. Differentiate between unary, binary, and ternary operators in JavaScript. Give examples of each.

Answer:

Unary Operators:
Operate on a single operand.
Example:
let x = 5;
let y = -x; // Unary negation


Binary Operators:
Operate on two operands.
Example:
let a = 10;
let b = 20;
let sum = a + b; // Binary addition


Ternary (Conditional) Operator:
Takes three operands and is a shorthand for an if-else statement.
Example:
let isEven = (num % 2 === 0) ? "Even" : "Odd";
