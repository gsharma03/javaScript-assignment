Q4. Discuss the precedence and associativity of operators in JavaScript. Why is understanding these concepts
important?

Answeer:

Precedence in JavaScript refers to the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. Operators with higher precedence are executed first.

Associativity defines the order in which operators of the same precedence are executed. It can be left-to-right (left-associative) or right-to-left (right-associative).

Understanding these concepts is crucial because they determine the order of operations in complex expressions, ensuring that the code behaves as intended. For example:


let result = 5 + 10 * 2; // Multiplication has higher precedence than addition
Here, multiplication is performed first due to its higher precedence.



If you want to change the order, you can use parentheses to explicitly specify precedence:
let result = (5 + 10) * 2; // Addition is performed first
Without a proper understanding of precedence and associativity, the evaluation order might lead to unexpected results.
