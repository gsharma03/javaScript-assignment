What is the purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript, and how do you declare them using the
'let' keyword?

Answer:
Declaring variables in JavaScript allows you to store and manage data in the memory. Variables hold values that can be updated or referenced later in the program, providing a way to store and work with data dynamically.
The 'let' keyword is used for variable declaration. It creates a variable and optionally initializes it with a value.
example:
let age; 
let name = "John";
