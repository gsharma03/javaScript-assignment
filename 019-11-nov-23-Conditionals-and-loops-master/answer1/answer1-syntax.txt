Conditional statements are used to make decisions based on whether a certain condition evaluates to true or false. These statements allow your code to execute different blocks of code depending on the specified conditions. In JavaScript, common conditional statements include if, else if, and else.
Syntax:
if (condition1) {
    //    Code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    //    Code to be executed if condition2 is true
} else {
    //    Code to be executed if none of the conditions is true
 }
